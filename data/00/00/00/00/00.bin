  |   Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival      |
  |   horror video game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril,   |
  |   developed by Stormind Games.                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies      |
  |   are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The       |
  |   plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same        |
  |   time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film        |
  |   narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the     |
  |   character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca           |
  |   Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old    |
  |   woman, who reaches Richard Felton's house, in order to investigate    |
  |   on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted   |
  |   by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton   |
  |   understands Rosemary's true intentions, the dread begins.             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the               |
  |   long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders     |
  |   and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for   |
  |   survival horror fans.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Audio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to    |
  |   understand when your stalkers are getting closer.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   In addition, the Nintendo Switch version of the game presents these   |
  |   extra features:                                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   * Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics    |
  |     make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action,      |
  |     strategic, hide 'n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in       |
  |     another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items    |
  |     more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and    |
  |     his path. Don't get too close to your enemy, act like an            |
  |     unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix   |
  |     these dynamics together                                             |
  |                                                                         |

  |   * Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris    |
  |     Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like             |
  |     characters                                                          |
  |                                                                         |

  |                                                                         |

  |     music for the game                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
